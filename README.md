# compassTracking

Minecraft Compass Tracking. Right click on a player or run the following commands to get the compass to track the player. Works in nether aswell.

## Commands

`
/setcompassplayer [player]
`

Will set your compass pointing to the player

`
/resetcompass 
`

Will reset the compass toward pointing to default spawn

## Upcoming Features

Will get put back blocks instead of overloading nether and end with lodestone

Resetting the compass is still a little buggy
